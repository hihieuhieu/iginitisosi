General react/typescript:
- typescript: language
- react is built by components. each component is a function (App.tsx, main.tsx, ...)
- given all components, the app is built. within components, it is only stated how the ui should look like
- 


> frontend/src/App.tsx
- function App() > return () --> return fake html page

> frontend/src/main.tsx
- main function, which incorporates all components (must be imported)
